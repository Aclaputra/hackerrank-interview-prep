# interview preparation
Hackerrank, Algorithms, Interview Preparation etc with various problems that I learned, will be using this for my Traveloka backend Interview again later wml

questions based on my failed experience dealing with software engineer interview at :
- Dana. (Java, SQL)(easy)
- Shopee. (Algorithms time complexity big O notation, mostly Python, Java is fine too)(hard)
- Traveloka. (Preferable Java, also a plus, System Design SQL)(medium)
- Google. (soon, but imo it will be C++ and Java)(idk)
