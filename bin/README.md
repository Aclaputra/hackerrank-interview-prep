# interview preparation
Hackerrank, Algorithms, Interview Preparation etc with various problems that I learned, will be using this for my Traveloka backend Interview again later wml

questions based on my failed experience dealing with software engineer interview at :
- Dana. (Java, SQL) (easy)
- Shopee. (Algorithms time complexity big O notation, mostly Python, Java is fine too) (hard)
- Traveloka. (Preferable Java, also a plus, System Design SQL) (medium)
- Google. (soon, but imo it will be C++ and Java) (idk yet)
- Meta. (soon, can be Java, Python, PHP or Hack) (idk yet)
